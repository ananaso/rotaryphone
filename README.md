# rotaryphone
This project contains the basic code to interface a Raspberry Pi with a rotary phone.
This includes functionality for reading the status of the hook (i.e. whether the handset is lifted or not),
whether the dialer is in use, and what number is being dialed. Additionally, this project includes interpreting
four-digit numbers being dialed and playing back an audio file based on that number.

Much of the inspiration and background reading for the project came from the following sources:

- https://www.sparkfun.com/tutorials/51

A big shoutout to https://pinout.xyz/ for keeping my head on straight throughout this whole project.
